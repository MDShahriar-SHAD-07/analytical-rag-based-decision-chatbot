# 🍽 Hybrid Entity-Aware RAG Restaurant Intelligence System

An advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based conversational analytics system for restaurant review intelligence, ranking, and multi-entity comparison.

This project integrates:

- Hybrid semantic + keyword retrieval
- Entity-aware query processing
- Dataset-level ranking engine
- Multi-restaurant comparative reasoning
- Confidence-aware decision modeling
- Human-friendly AI consultant interface

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional RAG systems focus only on semantic retrieval and LLM summarization.  
This system extends that architecture into a **Hybrid Analytical Decision Engine**.

Instead of simply summarizing reviews, the system:

- Aggregates structured metrics from dataset
- Computes sentiment distribution
- Calculates dominance scores
- Supports Top-N ranking (Top 5 / Top 50)
- Performs multi-restaurant comparison
- Generates consultant-style human-readable responses
